## How to Use?

1. **Ensure Python 3 and Git are installed on your machine.**
2. **Make sure Git is configured with your GitHub account.**
3. **Create a new empty GitHub repository** (either public or private, but I recommend private). Do not initialize it with a README.
4. **Download the script** (`dev.py`) and open it in your preferred text editor.
5. **Remove the `commit.txt` file** from the repository folder.
6. **Configure the script** as per your needs. Update the following variables in the script:

```python
total_day = 366  # Number of days to go back in time
commit_frequency = 10  # Number of commits to make per day
repo_link = "https://github.com/yourusername/yourrepository.git"  # Link to your GitHub repository
```
